              My idea with this project was to create a website for any small organization like a community park, a church or a book club. A group like this has very basic information that can be fitted in one page, but it the user can understand better if the information presented in one section at a time. My idea was to put all the organization data (including the titles of the menus) in a json object. In this way the code can be re-used for a different organization with a minimum effort. I am still working on the project because I want to add the image references to the json object too. This will make the page transformation even faster.

             I came with this project after a long period of inactivity in coding. I wanted to strength my skills and understand better how React and CSS Grid work. From that perspective I am very satisfied with the result because I proved myself that I can built things with coding. 
            </p>

             The major challenge on this project was to understand how children components can communicate with their parents by passing functions as a props. My code still needs some improvements on that area. I am confident that I will come with a better version very soon.
